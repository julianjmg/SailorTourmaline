            <p> Terracotta is a first person POV game created by Olivia Haines that is described as
                “a short walk to gather your thoughts.” She created this game to help express a
                depression that took place over a couple of months. Her feelings and thoughts were
                directly reflected onto the main character of the game as the text explicitly states
                her thoughts. </p>

            <p> I found this game to be more of an experience or even a walk-through. There is no
                real objective or goal other than to walk and explore a beautifully created
                terracotta town. Terracotta is very immersive. I found the art style to be
                simplistic yet effective and I very much did enjoy the warm and saturated color
                pallet. Another note that I would like to add to the color pallet is that at the
                very start of the game, you are in a cool-toned purple room with only one window in
                it. When you leave your house and begin to explore the town, you’ll see that all the
                colors are very warm in contrast to the lonely dark room. This connects directly to
                the MC’s (main character) depression. Not only was it immersive visually, but
                auditorily too. Once again, in the lonely room, there are is absolutely no sound,
                but as soon as you leave the room, you can hear a comfortable ambient noise which
                consists of a light bird chirping and wind sounds. Once you pass through the town
                and make it to the Cat Café, a Lofi type of beat begins to play which is very
                relaxing. Not only are the graphics and sounds of the game immersive, but they also
                play into the pattern that the MC is accepting their feelings more as the game
                progresses. </p>
