        <h3>About</h3>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> Terracotta is a first person POV game created by Olivia Haines that is described as
                “a short walk to gather your thoughts.” She created this game to help express a
                depression that took place over a couple of months. Her feelings and thoughts were
                directly reflected onto the main character of the game as the text explicitly states
                her thoughts. </p>

        <h3>Immersion</h3>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> I found this game to be more of an experience or even a walk-through. There is no
                real objective or goal other than to walk and explore a beautifully created
                terracotta town. Terracotta is very immersive. I found the art style to be
                simplistic yet effective and I very much did enjoy the warm and saturated color
                pallet. Another note that I would like to add to the color pallet is that at the
                very start of the game, you are in a cool-toned purple room with only one window in
                it. When you leave your house and begin to explore the town, you’ll see that all the
                colors are very warm in contrast to the lonely dark room. This connects directly to
                the MC’s (main character) depression. Not only was it immersive visually, but
                auditorily too. Once again, in the lonely room, there are is absolutely no sound,
                but as soon as you leave the room, you can hear a comfortable ambient noise which
                consists of a light bird chirping and wind sounds. Once you pass through the town
                and make it to the Cat Café, a Lofi type of beat begins to play which is very
                relaxing. Not only are the graphics and sounds of the game immersive, but they also
                play into the pattern that the MC is accepting their feelings more as the game
                progresses. </p>

        <h3>Character</h3>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> As we progress through the game, we get to learn more and more about the MC. We find
                out that they have been struggling with depression and burnout from work as well. I
                like that the MC doesn’t have a name or character model because it allows more
                people to be able to relate to the character and truly go through the game as
                themselves. </p>

        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> I did not find Terracotta to be challenging at all, but I was not expecting it to
                be. This game was made for the developer to self-express. It was not made to appeal
                to gamers (the average demographic,) which Is what I often see. But back to the
                challenge of the game. The way to “beat” the game is to explore the whole town and
                make it to the Cat Café. Along the way, there are barriers that will keep you from
                progressing until you have explored each area. When you walk in close proximity to
                an area that you have not explored, text will appear and share the MC’s thoughts.
                While I really do enjoy this game and think it was beautifully well done, I thought
                of a game mechanic that could work for Terracotta. The idea is that there would be
                items that you could collect like a key that would get you through each area.
                Currently, there are barriers that are drawn as diagonal lines and if keys were
                implemented, then maybe physical doors or even gates could be added.</p>

        <h3>Kumu Network</h3>
        <iframe src="https://embed.kumu.io/9aba0da770ff26ba1b301ad2f8edb01e" width="940"
            height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> I created a kumu graph to see what kind of relationship there was between the
                objects/drawings and the different locations of the game. The same pattern where the
                MC accepts their feelings more as the game progresses is also illustrated on this
                graph. I made my kumu network to look similar to a game roadmap so that you can see
                which objects/drawings are present in each area. Based on this network, I was able
                to find that are more animated drawings as you progress through the game. As I had
                said previously, there was a tone shift from cool colors to warm colors and also
                from no sound to ambient sounds to a Lofi song. In this example however, I think
                it’s a bit more literal as the word animated can mean lively. In the very first
                room, there were no animated drawings, but at the Cat Café, every single animated
                drawing was there. Thus, meaning that from this walk and formation of thoughts, the
                MC was able to accept their feelings and even feeling better. </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> Overall, I really enjoyed this game and I think that it's so well done and simply
                beautiful. I love that it was made for self-expression and I feel that many people
                who play it will feel validated for having similar emotions as the MC. </p>
