        <h1> Reflection on Two Different Approaches to Website Development </h1>
        <p> As a new learner of both WordPress and HTML, one of the greatest challenges for me was
            the expectations that I created for these website builders. I completely expected HTML
            to be as challenging as I made it, but WordPress completely took me by surprise. I
            thought that WordPress would be this easy website builder that I could easily create
            with, but I truly had a challenging time finding anything. Of course, I could have just
            looked up any information that I needed, but the user interface is not very
            beginner-friendly. I was finding tools not where I was not expecting them to be, and
            overall, the UI was the most unpleasant thing for me about WordPress. </p>
        <p> Normally when I paint, I limit my color palette so that I am not overwhelmed by the
            sheer number of options that I could choose for my artwork, but with website building, I
            found that I could do more with HTML. I simply felt limited by WordPress. It is great
            for starting website development without having prior experience in coding, but it is
            well worth the time to learn HTML and have more design options. What I like about
            WordPress is that designing the layout and adding the colors is super simple, whereas in
            HTML, you would have to add the style element to everything that needs it. </p>
        <p> There was definitely a challenge for editing layout, but mostly in HTML. HTML has a
            large number of details that you can change about the layout such as the padding,
            margin, borders, etc. And as someone who is new to HTML, it was quite overwhelming to
            me. Something else that was annoying while working in HTML was that I was unable to view
            my website as I was editing the code. I had to click onto “author” mode to view the
            website and click “text” to go back to edit the code. </p>
        <p>A skill that contributes a lot towards website development would be some sort of eye for
            design. When I view a website and it looks unorganized, ugly, or outdated, I would most
            likely stop using that website. That’s why I think having an understanding of graphic
            design is incredibly important for web page design. That’s why I want to learn more
            about graphic design, but I also want to learn more HTML code so that I can be a bit
            more experimental with my ideas. </p>
