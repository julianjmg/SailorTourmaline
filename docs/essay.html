            <h1> Reflection on Two Different Approaches to Website Development </h1>
            <p> As a new learner of both WordPress and HTML, one of the greatest challenges for me
                was the expectations that I created. I completely expected HTML to be challenging
                because of my little knowledge of HTML code, but WordPress completely took me by
                surprise. I thought that WordPress would be this easy website builder that I could
                easily create with, but I truly had a challenging time finding anything. Of course,
                I could have just looked up any information that I needed, but the user interface is
                not very beginner-friendly. I was finding tools not where I was not expecting them
                to be, and overall, the UI was the most unpleasant thing. </p>
            <p> Normally when I paint, I limit my color palette so that I am not overwhelmed by the
                sheer number of options that I could choose for my artwork, but with website
                building, I found that having more options and tools was a bit more inspiring. I
                simply felt limited by WordPress. It is great for starting website development
                without having prior experience in coding, but it is well worth the time to learn
                HTML and have more design options. What I like about WordPress is how simple it is
                to create a layout and choose colors, whereas in HTML, you would have to add the
                style element to everything that needs it. </p>
            <p> There was definitely a challenge for editing layout in HTML. HTML has a large number
                of details that you can change about the layout such as the padding, margin,
                borders, etc. And as someone who is new to HTML, it was quite overwhelming to me.
                Something else that was annoying while working in HTML was that I was unable to view
                my website as I was editing the code. I had to click onto “author” mode to view the
                website and click “text” to go back to edit the code. </p>
            <p>A skill that contributes a lot towards website development would be some sort of eye
                for design. When I view a website and it looks unorganized, ugly, or outdated, I
                would most likely stop using that website. That’s why I think having an
                understanding of graphic design is incredibly important for web page design. That’s
                why I want to learn more about graphic design, but I also want to learn more HTML
                code so that I can be a bit more experimental with my ideas and design. </p>
