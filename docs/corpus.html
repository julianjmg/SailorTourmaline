            <p> Based on the information from Voyant Tools, I found out that the most frequently
                used words in the Radio Play Collection were: oh, know, yes, sound, and it’s. This
                made quite a bit of sense for the collection of radio plays because of the large
                variety, but then I took a look into the suspense plays and I found that the most
                frequently used words were: sound, oh, music, yes, and I’m, which kind of surprised
                me. I figured that there would be more “spooky” or suspenseful words, but over half
                of the most frequently used words are shared with the larger radio play collection.
                And of course, the words in common were: oh, sound, and yes. That made me wonder how
                these words are used differently in each collection of radio plays. So, then I began
                to look at these words in context. First, I’ll be looking at the word sound. </p>

        <h4> "sound"</h4>

        <section class="writing">
            <p> I took these files into AntConc and I searched for the word sound in context. Once
                again, I wasn’t too surprised with what I found for the large collection of radio
                plays. “Sound” was used for sound effects in the scripts for the radio plays and
                they mostly contained a lot of applause, laughing, and knocking types of sound
                effects. But what I did find for the Suspense radio plays was that the sound effects
                were definitely more specified for this genre. I found a lot of police sirens,
                pounding, rattling, and radio sound effects, which I found pretty interesting. When
                I think of the suspense genre, I often think of the corny thriller/suspense movies
                that would be shown on the lifetime channel, and I think that these sounds are
                something that I would definitely be hearing in those movies. Next, I’m going to be
                taking a look at the word “oh” and how it compares in each collection. </p>
        </section>
        <h4> "oh"</h4>
        <section class="writing">
            <p> I know that the word oh is used as a reaction whether that reaction be positive or
                negative and I think that the large collection of radio plays will use “oh” as a mix
                of both positive and negative reactions, whereas the suspense collection will use oh
                in a more negative sense. </p>

        <section class="writing">
            <p> I was somewhat right about the suspense radio plays. There was a decent number of
                negative reactions such as “oh, my arm” and “oh, my clock” but I found something a
                bit more frequent and interesting. Something that I had completely forgotten about
                with the word “oh,” was calling out to someone. And this makes complete sense for
                the suspense genre because someone would be in dire need and they would be calling
                out “oh John!” or “oh Mrs. Robinson!” for help. This was something that really
                surprised me as I didn’t even think about the use of “oh” in this type of way. </p>

            <p> When I was looking at “oh” in the context of the large collection of radio plays, I
                found that my guess was pretty accurate. The “oh” was consistently a reaction
                towards something either positive or negative, but I didn’t see much of the calling
                out for someone that took place in the suspense plays. My reasoning for this is that
                it may be more of a genre-specific thing which is why the “calling out for someone”
                wasn’t seen as frequently in the large collection of radio plays. </p>

                this and I wanted to see if “don’t would appear as frequently as in the large
                collection of radio plays. And as it turns out, “don’t” appears less frequently in
                comparison to the suspense radio plays. </p>

            <p> I had found that the most frequent N-Gram is "don't" which can be associated with
                negativity/negation. And I think it's pretty cool how that's the most frequent
                N-Gram in the suspense radio plays because usually in this type of genre, there's
                always a character that says "don't do this" and foreshadows future events, usually
                tragedies. And this type of “forewarning” happened quite a bit. There was a lot of
                “don’t do it”, “don’t (insert name), and so on. When I looked at the most frequent
                N-Grams for all of the large collection of radio plays, I found "don't" as the third
                most frequent N-Grams. But when I took a look at the Key Words in Context, I found
                that its use was quite a bit different. “Don't” was used in a more conversational
                way rather than as a warning such as: "don't agree with him" or "don't answer him.”

            <p> When I moved to the n-gram size of 3, I found something super cool in the suspense
                collection! I had discovered the n-gram “THEN IN BG” which I’m assuming means then
                in background. From what it looks like out of context, it seems that it would be
                used to set up this super dramatic event. And it turns out that’s exactly what it
                does. I saw a ton of things like “in the background, David saw something” and even
                combined “THEN IN BG” with “SOUND” to create an even more suspenseful mood. They
                were used together to create sounds like police sirens, hurried footsteps, and
                running steps in snow. Because of how important it seems that “THEN IN BG” seems to
                be in the suspense genre, it made me wonder how frequently and how differently it
                could be used in the large collection of radio plays. </p>

            <p> In comparison to the suspense plays, the large collection of radio plays used “then
                in BG” less frequently. The large collection used “then in BG” 183 times and ranked
                50 based on frequency while the suspense collection of radio plays used it 162 times
                and ranked 2 based on frequency. And I think that this is pretty considerable
                because the large collection has 199 text files while the suspense collection only
                has 38 total text files. This means that “then in BG” must have been more commonly
                used in this type of genre then in any other genre in radio plays. Not only that,
                but “sound” when used in conjunction with “then in BG” was used less frequently in
                the large collection than the suspense collection. And I think that this was more
                abundant in the suspense collection because the background sounds would be adding
                more layers to the suspensefulness of it all making a more engaging environment for
                their listeners. </p>
